- An easy to understand and efficient prime number generator in C. 
- Uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
- Uses single bit manipulation and a bitmap with 8 boolean values per byte to save memory. 
- Writes output to terminal or file. 
- Completely open source and free to use for any purposes.
*( Relatively fast for generating all primes up to an integer n, 
not for generating a single prime or the nth prime )
**( There are faster, more complicated algorithms than this one,
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin )
